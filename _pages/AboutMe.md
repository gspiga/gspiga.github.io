Hello and welcome to my website! I am a graduate student, pursuing a Master of Science in Statistics at the University of California Davis. I am expected to graduate in Fall of 2023. I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Statistics and minor in computer science also at the University of California Davis in spring of 2022. I also possess two Associates in Arts degrees, one in Business and the other in Natural Sciences, from Pasadena City College in Spring of 2020.
