Hello and welcome to my website! With a Master of Science in Statistics from UC Davis and a focus on data science, I bring a blend of analytical rigor and practical experience to the field of data science. My expertise spans Python, R, and SQL, applied in real-world contexts such as customer churn analysis, web traffic data mining, and predictive modeling for healthcare. At UltraViolet and UC Davis Health, I demonstrated my ability to turn complex data into actionable insights, enhancing customer experiences and informing strategic decisions.

I thrive on solving challenging problems with data, leveraging tools like Snowflake and Python to uncover patterns and drive business outcomes. My technical skills are complemented by a certification in SQL for Data Science and a passion for continuous learning. I'm eager to contribute to projects that value innovation, precision, and a data-driven approach.
