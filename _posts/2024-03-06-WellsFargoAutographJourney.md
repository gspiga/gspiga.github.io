Wells Fargo has announced their Autograph Journey card, a new addition to the Autograph collection. While the original Autograph card is quite strong in earning categories, it misses one major advantage, transfer partners. This is where the Journey comes in, introducing new airlines to transfer points to, new earning categories, and an annual credit. 


Over the past year, I have taken a strong interest in what some call the "Credit Card Game", learning how to use credit cards to your advantage to earn points for (almost) free travel, as well as other perks. If you would like a more formal introduction or a how-to guide on how to get started on this, let me know. If I get enough interest I will write more articles on how you can unlock this new way of traveling. For now, let's talk about this new Wells Fargo card. 

Right off the bat, this card looks to be a direct competitor with the Chase Saphire Preferred: an identical standard sign-up bonus of 60,000 points, a $95 annual fee, and a $50 annual credit towards traveling. However, there is an exciting difference here, the reward multipliers for your spend. These multiplies are what allow you to get maximized earning potential from your spend. You get:
- 5x on Hotels
- 4x on Airlines
- 3x on all other travel and dining
- 1x on other purchases
The baseline value for points is $0.01 per point. So 100 points is worth $1. What is the advantage of these points? The simplest level is to use them directly through Wells Fargo to redeem for travel. Want to book a flight for $500? You can use 50,000 points instead. Expert level usage of the points is transfering these points to airline loyalty programs, where you can often exceed the value of 1 cent per point (cpp) when redeeming.
