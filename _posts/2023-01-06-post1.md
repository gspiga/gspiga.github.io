Hello and welcome to the first blog post! These posts will be a preview of projects I am working on, research interests, career updates, and more. The purpose of this site is as a personal project of mine for the new year. I think a personal landing page like this is a great way for me to have an outlet for topics that I find interesting and highlight portions of my education in statistics and data science as I work toward my Master's of Science in Statistics throughout the year. I hope you enjoy and are provided useful knoweldge from these posts. If you would like to contact me, please use the links provided on the left side of the page.
